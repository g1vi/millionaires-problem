# Millionaires' problem (RSA solution)
A solution to Yao's millionaires' problem using RSA as cryptosystem.  

The problem was introduced by Andrew Yao in 1982, and discusses how could two (or more) millionaires know which of them is richer without revealing their actual wealth. A solution based on RSA is presented here.

The protocol could be used when it is necessary to compare 2 numbers or quantities but maintaining the privacy of the users (e.g. an online payment service checking creditworthibess of a user).
